### About the Experiment 
Development of a new software, like any other product, remains incomplete until it subjected to exhaustive tests. The primary objective of testing is not to verify that all desired features have been implemented correctly. However, it also includes verification of the software behavior in case of "bad inputs".

In this experiment we discuss in brief about different types of testing, and provide mechanisms to have hands-on experience on unit testing.
